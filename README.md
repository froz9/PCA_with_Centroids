# PCA_with_Centroids
## DESCRIPTION:
This script performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on metabolomics data. It then calculates the centroids for predefined groups within the data and generates scatter plots of the principal components (PCs). These plots visualize the relationship between individual data points and their respective group centroids, helping to assess within-group cohesion and between-group separation.
